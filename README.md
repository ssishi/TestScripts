Cocktail Exercise
Test Script Summary:
This test script encompasses a comprehensive set of functionalities for the Cocktail
Database API. It addresses various aspects such as searching for both alcoholic and nonalcoholic ingredients, validating ingredient details by ID, retrieving popular cocktails,
searching for cocktails by name and ingredient, and fetching details of random cocktails.
Moreover, the script includes tests to gracefully handle invalid inputs, search for cocktails
with non-existent ingredients, and conduct case-insensitive searches. Regression testing is
incorporated to ensure consistent data structure in API responses.
Each test case verifies specific aspects of the API's functionality and response structure,
thereby ensuring the reliability and consistency of the API's behavior. Overall, the script
offers thorough coverage of the Cocktail Database API's features and rigorously validates its
correctness across diverse scenarios.
